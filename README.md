# H1-B-Data-Analysis

This project is about H1B visa data, which is a very important topic. Each year, more than 300,000 F-1 visas are issued by the U.S., allowing foreign students to study in the U.S. and work for 3 years. At the conclusion of the 3 years, these workers must obtain an H1B visa to continue working in the U.S. The H1B visa allows U.S. employers to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. For this project, we used data from the last 2 years to analyze trends in H1B visa usage by observing geographic statistics along with data by job sector and employer. This can help potential H1B employees identify companies and cities in which they will have a higher chance of obtaining a visa and continuing a professional career.
